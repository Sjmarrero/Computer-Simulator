In part 1 of the Computer Simulator, the main method only 
instantiates the computer object and call run method to 
start the computer simulator. Each classes such as Register,
Adder, Complementer, Reader, Printer, and bus are created 
to perform specific functions as instructed in the instruction. 
Each classes are provided with method to set its input and 
method to get its output. Class Bus is used to transfer
data from class Reader class to class Printer. 
Class Computer instantiates necessary components and 
registers in the method build() and method run() simulates 
the execution of program. It calls on necessary 
methods to carry out the execution.

Part 1 executes the given instruction set as follow:

READMOVE R0,R1READMOVE R0,R2ADD R1,R2,R3MOVE R3,R0PRINTREADMOVE  R0, R1SUBTRACT R1,R3,R0PRINTREADMOVE R0,R2ADD R3,R2,R1MOVE R1,R0PRINT


Output:

As the instruction above, the program reads
a number from keyboard and moves it to R1.

* 
9
			MOVE part2.Register@4aa298b7,part2.Register@7d4991ad

The program reads another number and
 moves it to R2.

* 
7
			MOVE part2.Register@4aa298b7,part2.Register@28d93b30

It adds the values in R1 and R2 an puts 
the sum in R3.

>> 16
			ADD part2.Register@7d4991ad,part2.Register@28d93b30,part2.Register@1b6d3586
			MOVE part2.Register@1b6d3586,part2.Register@4aa298b7

The program reads another number and moves it to R1.

* 
2
			MOVE part2.Register@4aa298b7,part2.Register@7d4991ad

It subtract the value in R3 (previous sum)
to the new number entered.

>> 14			SUBTRACT part2.Register@7d4991ad,part2.Register@1b6d3586,part2.Register@4aa298b7

The program reads another number and moves
 it to R2.

* 
-1
			MOVE part2.Register@4aa298b7,part2.Register@28d93b30

It adds the values in R3 and R2 and 
puts the sum in R1.

R1 is moved to R0. 

>> 15
			ADD part2.Register@1b6d3586,part2.Register@28d93b30,part2.Register@7d4991ad
			MOVE part2.Register@7d4991ad,part2.Register@4aa298b7
